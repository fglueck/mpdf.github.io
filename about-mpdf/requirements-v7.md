Since mPDF 7.0 requires:
 * PHP &ge; 5.6.0 and < 7.4.0.
 * PHP 7.3 is supported since mPDF `v7.1.7`
 * PHP 7.4 is supported since mPDF `v8.0.4`
 * PHP `mbstring` (including `mbregex`, which needs to
   be explicitly enabled in some environments) and `gd` extensions have to be loaded.

Additional extensions may be required for some advanced features such as `zlib` for compression of embedded
resources such as fonts or `bcmath` for generating barcodes or `xml` for character set conversion
and SVG handling.

mPDF is **not** compatible with PHP function overloading (`mbstring.func_overload`)

As for importing existing PDF files with FPDI, PHP requires `zlib` extension for compression.

`curl` extension is used for remote HTTP calls when available.

mPDF has some problems with fetching external HTTP resources with single threaded servers such as `php -S`. A proper
server such as nginx (php-fpm) or Apache is recommended.
